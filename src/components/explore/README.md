# Explore

This component is the root view of the explore set of pages and shows a list of all spaces in a hierarchical sidebar. When clicked, the user is sent to the explore detail page for each space (initially the Trends page).

We attempt to maintain the Time Segment as we move from space to space, and from trends -> daily.
