# Environment

This page is used to add and manage spaces and doorways, and also provide a mechanism to link them
together.

The page consists of two columns: a list of spaces and a list of doorways. Spaces have a number of
linked doorways within them. Users drag doorways from the doorways column to the spaces column to
link them together.
